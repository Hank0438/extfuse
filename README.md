# Extension Framework for FUSE

* LibExtFUSE code Coming soon!

We have modifed the FUSE driver to support ExtFUSE feature. Therefore, you will have to install and run a our modified kernel. To clone the kernel sources do:
```
git clone --branch ExtFUSE-1.0 https://github.com/extfuse/linux 
```

You will also need a modified FUSE library. To clone its source repo:
```
git clone --branch ExtFUSE-1.0 https://github.com/extfuse/libfuse
```
